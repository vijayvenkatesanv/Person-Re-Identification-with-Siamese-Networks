# Person-Re-Identification-with-Siamese-Networks
Implemented a Siamese Network with Triplet Loss for Person Re-Identification using PyTorch. Trained the model on an Anchor-Positive-Negative (APN) dataset to learn feature embeddings for distinguishing identities. This approach is widely used in face recognition, authentication, and verification tasks.
